# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher (Redone)

I completed this challenge about a half year ago, and decided to re-visit this task but this time flex my fullstack knowledge a bit more. the project itself consist of a MERN stack and I tried my best to prioritize performance and functionality above all, really happy with out this one came out in comparison to my first attempt I'll have a link to the backend code down below.
